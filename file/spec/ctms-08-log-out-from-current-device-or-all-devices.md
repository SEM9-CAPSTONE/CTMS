**Story Title**  
Log Out from Current Device or All Devices

**Status**  
To Do

**Story**  
As a user, I want to log Out from Current Device or All Devices so that the CTMS workflow is completed safely, consistently, and within the correct business scope.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The current token is revoked.
- [ ] the log out from all devices option invalidates every refresh token.

## Business Rules Checklist
- [ ] BR-022: Sensitive personal data may only be accessed by the user or authorized roles.
- [ ] BR-023: Logging out from the current device must revoke the refresh token for that session.
- [ ] BR-200: Every change must be written to the audit log.
- [ ] BR-201: Every function requiring authentication may only be performed when the user has a valid login session and the account is active.
- [ ] BR-202: Accounts in pending_verification, suspended, or deleted status must not use functions that require an active account, except allowed verification or recovery flows.
- [ ] BR-204: Users may only view or change data they own unless their role and business relationship allow access to another user's data.
- [ ] BR-205: All input data must be validated for required fields, data type, format, length, enum values, and cross-field relationships before processing.
- [ ] BR-206: The backend is the final authority for permissions, status, pricing, capacity, inventory, risk level, and transaction results; clients must not set these values by themselves.
- [ ] BR-207: Every change involving multiple tables or records must run in a transaction; if one step fails, the whole business operation must roll back.
- [ ] BR-209: Operations that may be retried, such as payment, refund, callback, and synchronization, must support idempotency so one request cannot be successfully processed more than once.
- [ ] BR-214: Every data relationship must reference an existing and valid record; child records must not be created for resources outside the correct business scope.
- [ ] BR-215: Emails must be normalized before comparison and storage; phone numbers must be normalized to a consistent format, preferably E.164.
- [ ] BR-220: A valid time range must have a start time earlier than the end time, unless the business rule explicitly allows equality.
- [ ] BR-230: External-service retries must have limits and backoff; retries must not create duplicate records or transactions.
- [ ] BR-231: APIs must return consistent error codes: 401 for authentication failure, 403 for insufficient permission, 404 for not found, 409 for business conflict, and 422 for invalid data.
- [ ] BR-242: When the backend rejects a request because data changed concurrently, the UI must preserve entered data, display the reason, and allow reload or retry.
- [ ] BR-243: Cases with insufficient permission or unmet business conditions must not create any side effect.
- [ ] BR-244: Changes to Business Rules, enums, state transitions, or API contracts must update the Spec, test cases, and data documentation together before Done.

## Story-Specific Risks and Edge Cases
- Missing authorization or ownership checks can expose CTMS data across users, roles, trips, campsites, or bookings.
- Concurrent requests, duplicate submissions, stale reads, and retry behavior can create inconsistent state if transactions and idempotency are not handled.
- UI validation must improve the user experience but must never replace backend validation or permission checks.
- State transitions must reject invalid source states and preserve a clear error response for the user or calling service.
- Any mapped BR missing from tests creates a release risk and must be resolved before Done.

## Functional and Domain Requirements
- Implement the `Log Out from Current Device or All Devices` workflow exactly within `EPIC 1. Authentication`.
- Enforce role-based access before executing any domain action.
- Validate all required fields, enum values, date ranges, ownership boundaries, and cross-entity references before writing data.
- Return consistent API errors: 401 for authentication failures, 403 for authorization failures, 404 for missing resources, 409 for business conflicts, and 422 for invalid input.

## Data and Persistence Requirements
- Persist only validated data and keep all foreign-key relationships scoped to existing, authorized CTMS records.
- Use transactions for multi-record updates, capacity checks, payments, booking changes, equipment changes, synchronization, or any workflow with side effects.
- Store timestamps in a consistent server-side format and preserve source timestamps when client-side events are synchronized later.
- Avoid hard deletes unless the related database model and business rule explicitly allow them.

## State and Audit Requirements
- Validate the current state before every transition and reject transitions that are not explicitly allowed.
- Record important create, update, approval, cancellation, payment, synchronization, administrative, and safety-related actions in audit logs.
- Capture actor, target type, target id, before value, after value, timestamp, and reason whenever those fields apply.
- Notify affected users when the workflow changes booking, trip, route, campsite, Porter, SOS, emergency, or administrative state.

## File Structure Notes
- Backend: place controllers, DTOs, services, repositories, guards, and tests in the module that owns the domain entity.
- Frontend: place screens, components, hooks, API clients, schemas, and tests in the feature folder that owns the workflow.
- Shared constants, enums, query keys, and validation schemas should be centralized only when reused by more than one feature.
- Keep migration, seed, and fixture changes close to the persistence model they support.

## Implementation Guidance for the Dev Agent
- Start by reading the existing module patterns before adding new files or abstractions.
- Keep the implementation narrow to this story and reuse existing CTMS helpers for auth, validation, transactions, i18n, API errors, and tests.
- Build backend behavior first when the UI depends on an API contract, then wire the frontend to the typed contract.
- Do not mark the story Done until mapped ACs, business rules, audit behavior, and regression tests are all covered.

## Testing Requirements
- Add unit tests for domain validation, permission checks, state transitions, and mapped business rule violations.
- Add API or integration tests for success, invalid input, unauthorized access, missing resource, conflict, and rollback cases.
- Add UI/component tests for rendering, validation messages, disabled states, loading states, error handling, and successful submission where UI exists.
- Add E2E coverage for the primary user journey and at least one critical failure path.
- Every BR listed in the Business Rules Checklist must appear in at least one test or review evidence item.
